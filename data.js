        description: "BMW is so proud of the high-quality engine that it produces that it has designed its Germany headquarters to mimic it. The design replicates a four-cylinder engine. Interestingly enough, the same four-cylinder engine is what made the WWI airplane so successful in its time. The headquarters also has a museum next door which features the history of BMW development."

        description: "Long before Jeep became the brand of adventure, it was the brand that delivered the first prototype for World War II ally use, and it was first revealed on Armistice Day. The US Army asked 135 car manufacturers for designs of a “light reconnaissance” vehicle and got only three responses. Willys-Overland was one of those three, and the design of the Quad was born. This was the very first Jeep to be built, and it was sent overseas for ally use in England and Russia."
